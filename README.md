Hi! 
My name is Rafel Ballester Coll and my story begins in Mallorca, Spain in 1988. I am one of those who think that in the horizon of any person there are always countless important things that build and define him. In my case, I grew up being in love with letters, history and philosophy, however, after a career and several years working in the publishing industry I decided to put a stop to this chapter and focus on another of my great passions, technology.
At the end of the year 2021 I left my job and decided to go back to study, during this time I have taken the "Google UX/UI Certificate" and practically finished the "TÃ©cnico Superior en Desarrollo de Aplicaciones Web" at the UOC.

Apart from this, I have taken the opportunity to train myself self-taught in Design, acquiring a fairly acceptable level in the Adobe Application Pack and Figma. And on the other hand, I have acquired quite a lot of fluency in several programming languages.
Nowadays I continue training myself daily, recycling my knowledge and practicing every day. 


#### ðŸŒ± Things I am currently working on: 
- Finishing the Senior Technician in Web Application Development  
- Learning to Develop on Cardano's BlockChain 
- Participating as a Developer and NFT Artist in Cardano's BlockChain
